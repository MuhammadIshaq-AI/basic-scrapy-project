But for this size, it fits my feet perfectly (I wear size 10-10.5 shoes). Other socks in this size range are a little tight on my feet, but these go right on. The thickness is just right, they don't feel too thick but they aren't thin either. I don't get any stretching of the sock where your foot starts to show through the thin material, like you see in some socks.I've been using these pretty much every day for a year and a half, and in all 10 pairs I don't have any holes or fraying or anything like that. I wish I bought more than 10 pairs at the time because I've tried other socks since then (not to replace these, but to expand my wardrobe) and honestly, none have been as good as these.

The socks sem to have reasonably good strength in the elastic, and we were able to wash it without any perceptible loss of color. I do urge you to wash it in a light setting to prevent the fabrics from being stretched and getting a bit torn in the process. All in all the price seems to be in a reasonable range and the quality is quite acceptable. The one thing that our daughter also did like was at the top of the socks there is a nice design (a bit like a ruffled type).

They don't slide down easily, but it can be a bit slippery on tile or wood for new walkers since there are no grips on the bottom.Overall, these socks wash well and are really cute.
