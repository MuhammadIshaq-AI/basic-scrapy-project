But for this size, it fits my feet perfectly (I wear size 10-10.5 shoes). Other socks in this size range are a little tight on my feet, but these go right on. The thickness is just right, they don't feel too thick but they aren't thin either. I don't get any stretching of the sock where your foot starts to show through the thin material, like you see in some socks.I've been using these pretty much every day for a year and a half, and in all 10 pairs I don't have any holes or fraying or anything like that. I wish I bought more than 10 pairs at the time because I've tried other socks since then (not to replace these, but to expand my wardrobe) and honestly, none have been as good as these.
